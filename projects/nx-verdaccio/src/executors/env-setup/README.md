# Setup Environment Executor

This executor helps to initiate an [environment folder](../../../../../README.md#-environment-folders-to-isolate-files-during-e2e-tests) and installs it`s dependent projects.
After running this task a ready to use environment is set up with packages published and installed with Verdaccio.

#### @push-based/nx-verdaccio:env-setup

> [!notice]
> The setup executor does not keep the Verdaccio server running.
> To keeping the server running pass **`--keepServerRunning`**

## Usage

// project.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets": {
    "env-setup": {
      "executor": "@push-based/nx-verdaccio:env-setup"
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the Nx executor will derive the options from the executor options.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets": {
    "env-setup": {
      "executor": "@code-pushup/nx-verdaccio:env-setup",
      "options": {
        "keepServerRunning": false
        "envRoot": "/tmp/test-npm-workspace"
        "verbose": true,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Show what will be executed without actually executing it:

`nx run my-project:env-setup --print-config`

| **printConfig**       | `boolean`                 | Print config without executing                                                                                                       |

## Examples

By default, the `env-setup` executor in combination with the `nx-verdaccio` plugin not need any configuration.

To give some examples, here are some common examples and their configurations:

### Change the environment root to a custom directory

By default, the environment root is set to `tmp/environments/<project-name>` where project name is the current executed task.
That means if you run `nx run my-project:env-setup` the environment root will be `tmp/environments/my-project`.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets": {
    "env-setup": {
      "options": {
        "envRoot": "/tmp/e2e/{projectName}"
      }
    },
    "e2e": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the environment root will be `/tmp/e2e/my-project` and all environment files will be stored there.

### Use a custom script for the environment setup

If you want to run a custom script after the environment is set up, you can use the `postScript` option.

The following example assumes that you will install the packages in a separate step and only publish the packages.
After the packages are published, the post script executes, installs the needed dependencies programmatically and then tears down the server.

```jsonc
// projects/my-project/project.json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets": {
    "env-setup": {
      "options": {
        "skipInstall": true,
        "postScript": "tsx --tsconfig=tsconfig.e2e.json projects/my-project/setup/global-setup.ts"
      }
    },
    "e2e": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// projects/my-project/setup/global-setup.ts

await copyFile(join(getTestEnvironmentRoot('my-project'), '.npmrc'), join(repoPath, '.npmrc'));
execSync('npm init @org/create-my-project');
```

In the above example, the `postScript` option is used to programmatically install the dependencies while still using the published packages from the Verdaccio registry.
This gives flexibility and control over the environment setup process. See the [cli-post-script-e2e](../../../../../examples/e2e/cli-post-script-e2e/README.md) project for a more real life example.

### Inspect the environment setup with the Verdaccio registry server running

If you want to inspect the environment setup with the server running, you can use the `keepServerRunning` option.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets": {
    "env-setup": {
      "options": {
        "keepServerRunning": true
      }
    },
    "e2e": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Executing the above configuration will keep the Verdaccio server running after the environment setup is finished.
The URL under which the Verdaccio server is running will be printed to the console and is also available in the `verdaccio.regirsty.json` file in the projects environment folder.
