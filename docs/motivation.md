Before we go into more detail let's quickly list the problems here to later on dive into each of them individually:

**The problems:**

- 🚪 **Isolation** - Conflicts the file system as well as changes in the local configuration of the developer machine.
- 📉 **Scalability** - The setup can only run in sequence and after every test we have to run a lot of cleanup scripts. In case of an error the whole chain has to rerun.
- 🐢 **Task Performance** - The test environment setup in not cacheable and as the server has to run while the tests execute, it slows done the whole task.
- 🔫 **DX** - In case of an error there is no easy way to debug the test setup independent of the test.
- 🧟‍ **Maintainability** - It is very hard to maintain the test setup as it is very complex and has a lot of moving partsnthat are hard to understand and debug.

Let's start off by explaining the common e2e setups.

## Common E2E setup for publishable packages

To get e2e tests setup with Verdaccio we typically need the following building blocks:

- A package we want to test
- A global setup script used by your testing lib to sets up the environment before running all tests
- A test executing the package

The interesting part here is the global setup script. So let's take a closer look at it this first.

The following is a simplified version of a global setup script used by your testing lib.

```ts
// global-env-setup.ts
import { rm } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { executeProcess, objectToCliArgs } from '@push-based/test-utils';
import { configureRegistry, RegistryResult, startVerdaccioServer, unconfigureRegistry } from '@push-based/tools-utils';

export async function setup() {
  const { verdaccioPort } = await startVerdaccioServer({
    storage: 'local-registry/storage',
  });

  // Configure npm with form the created Verdaccio registry
  // `npm config set registry http://localhost:${verdaccioPort}`
  // `npm config set //localhost:${verdaccioPort}:_authToken "my-auth-token"`
  configureRegistry(verdaccioPort);

  // Publish all packages to the Verdacio storage (local-registry/storage)
  // `npm publish <package-name> --registry=http://localhost:${verdaccioPort}`
  await publishProject('my-lib');

  // Install all packages locally
  // `npm install <package-name> --registry=http://localhost:${verdaccioPort}`
  await installProject('my-lib');
}

export async function teardown() {
  // Uninstall all package from the Verdacio storage (local-registry/storage)
  // `npm uninstall <package-name>`
  await uninstallProject('my-lib');

  // Revert configure npm with form the created Verdaccio registry
  // `npm config delete registry`
  // `npm config delete //localhost:${verdaccioPort}:_authToken`
  unconfigureRegistry(registry, isVerbose);

  stopVerdaccioServer();

  // Delete the Verdaccio storage
  await rm('local-registry/storage', { recursive: true, force: true });
}
```

Now you could run `nx run my-lib-e2e:e2e` which would start the server publish and install, executes the tests and runs the cleanup logic.
Viola, you have a working e2e setup for your package. 🎉

**But wait!** There are MANY caveats with this setup. We mentioned them already in the beginning, now let's discuss them one by one.

## 🚪 Isolation of the E2E tests

The following file tree is a result of running our e2e setup.
It is particular bad as it interfere with your local package manager configuration as well as conflicts with other tests if not run in sequence.

```sh
User/
 └── <user-name>/
     ├── .npmrc # 🔓 added registry and auth token entry to OS user specific npm config
     └──Root/ # 👈 this is your CWD
        ├── node_modules/
        │   └── @my-org
        │       └── my-lib/... # 🔓 npm install installs into repository folder
        ├── dist/
        │   └── packages/
        │       └── my-lib/...
        ├── e2e/
        │   └── my-lib-e2e/
        │       └── some.test.ts
        ├── tmp/
        │    ├── e2e/...
        │    │   └── <test-file-name>/...
        │    │        └── <it-block-env-setup>/...
        │    │             └── test.file.ts
        │    └── local-registry/
        │        └── storage/
        │            └── @my-org
        │                └── my-lib/... # npm publish saves the package's tarball here
        ├── package-lock.json # 🔓 npm install/uninstall installs into workspace root
        └── package.json # 🔓 npm install/uninstall installs into workspace root
```

As the tests change the local configuration of the package manager, it is not possible to run multiple tests in parallel.
Installing/uninstalling or publishing a package will end up in conflicts with other tests.
You are forced to run the tests in sequence.

**Publish conflict:**

1. Test A: `npm publish @push-based/pkg@0.0.1 --registry=http://localhost:4873` # ✅
2. Test B: `npm publish @push-based/pkg@0.0.1 --registry=http://localhost:4873` # ❌ package already exists in registry

**Install/uninstall conflict:**

1. Test A: `npm install @push-based/pkg@0.0.1 --registry=http://localhost:4873` # ✅
2. Test B: `npm install @push-based/pkg@0.0.1 --registry=http://localhost:4873` # ✅
3. Test B: `nx e2e pkg` # ✅
4. Test B: `npm uninstall @push-based/pkg@0.0.1 --registry=http://localhost:4873` # ✅
5. Test A: `nx e2e pkg` # ❌ package not installed

## 📉 Scalability

As mentioned the tests don't scale, which is mostly related to the first problem.

To run 1 E2E test the following chain has to happen:

- Start Verdaccio server - to be able to publish packages to and install from
- NPM publish the package to the Verdaccio server
- NPM install the package to the Start Verdaccio server
- Execute the actual E2E tests over Playwright, Vitest, Jest or other test runner
- NPM uninstall the package from the local setup
- Stop the Verdaccio server
- Delete the storage folder

As you can see, the majority of the tasks are just here as we can't parallelize. :(

### 🐢 Task Graph & Performance

Due to above reasons the project graph is hard to optimize and opaque as everything is hidden in 2 nodes

We already scratched that topic a bit, but in this chapter we can go in full detail.
Let's start with looking at the steps from above.

If we could run them in parallel the following steps would not need to happen:

- 🐢 NPM uninstall the package from the local setup
- 🐢 Delete the storage folder

If we would not have to keep the server running for the whole test we can also:

- 🐢 Stop wasting CPU power and memory that is consumed by the server
- 🐢 Think about options to cache parts of the steps

Especially the caching is interesting to dive deeper in.
Let's look at different scenarios and what they miss.

## 🔫 DX

As the logic that starts and stops Verdaccio is backed into the setup script it is very hard and cumbersome to debug or even see what is going on.

- Server always stops after test. There is no way to keep it running and look at the published packages
- After an error the server keeps running and there is no way to manually stop it again. A reboot or terminal command is necessary.
- Another thing related to errors is the configuration for the local registry is made in the users setup and therefore if not reverted manually no other package can be installed. Not even running `npm ci`

## 🧟‍ Maintainability

As mentioned the logic to set up and teardown the test environment is backed into the e2e tests global setup scripts.

This has several downsides when maintaining the code:

- Since the setup and teardown processes are baked into the scripts, they are not visible in the task graph, making it difficult for developers to see the dependencies and relationships between tasks.
  This results in unnecessary time spent digging into the code to understand the setup.
- With a large number of interconnected parts, updating the test environment or adjusting for new features can introduce bugs or cause existing tests to fail, increasing the chance for breaking changes.
- When an error occurs, it is not easy to isolate the issue or see which part of the setup failed.
  Developers have to manually step through the complex code to identify the problem, which slows down the development process a lot.
- The configuration for the local registry and other components is spread across different parts of the setup, adding to the complexity.
  This makes it harder to ensure that the environment is correctly configured across all tests.
